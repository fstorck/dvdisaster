.SH DESCRIPTION
.B DVDISASTER
provides a margin of safety against data loss on CD and DVD media caused by
scratches or aging media. It creates error correction data which is used to
recover unreadable sectors if the disc becomes damaged at a later time.

.SH TYPICAL USAGE

.TP
\fBdvdisaster\fP \fB-d\fP \fI/dev/hdc\fP \fB-s\fP
Scans the medium in drive \fI/dev/hdc\fP for errors.
.TP
\fBdvdisaster\fP \fB-d\fP \fI/dev/hdc\fP \fB-i\fP \fImedium.iso\fP \fB-r\fP
Reads an image from drive \fI/dev/hdc\fP into the file \fImedium.iso\fP.
.TP
\fBdvdisaster\fP \fB-d\fP \fI/dev/hdc\fP \fB-i\fP \fImedium.iso\fP \fB--read-raw\fP \fB-r\fP
Creates an image as described above. Each sector's integrity is verified
by using its EDC and L-EC raw data. Only possible for CD media; otherwise
the \fB--read-raw\fP option is silently ignored.
.TP
\fBdvdisaster\fP \fB-d\fP \fI/dev/hdc\fP \fB-i\fP \fImedium.iso\fP \fB--read-attempts\fP \fIn-m\fP \fB-r\fP
Creates an image as described above. Defective sectors are retried at least \fIn\fP
times and at most \fIm\fP times. Recovery of defective CD media may improve when
combined with \fB--read-raw\fI. 
.TP
\fBdvdisaster\fP \fB-d\fP \fI/dev/hdc\fP \fB-i\fP \fImedium.iso\fP \fB-e\fP \fIcorr.ecc\fP \fB-r\fP \fB--adaptive-read\fP
Uses the adaptive reading strategy to read an image from 
drive \fI/dev/hdc\fP into the file \fImedium.iso\fP.
Reading will stop when enough data has been
gathered to repair the image using the error correction file \fIcorr.ecc\fP.
.TP
\fBdvdisaster\fP \fB-i\fP \fImedium.iso\fP \fB-e\fP \fIcorr.ecc\fP \fB-c\fP
Creates an error correction file \fIcorr.ecc\fP for the image \fImedium.iso\fP.
.TP
\fBdvdisaster\fP \fB-i\fP \fImedium.iso\fP \fB-m\fIRS02\fP \fB-n\fP \fI350000\fP \fB-c\fP
Augments the image \fImedium.iso\fP with error correction information,
expanding the image to no more than \fI350000\fP sectors. If \fB-n\fP is omitted the image
will be expanded to the smallest possible medium size (CD, DVD, DVD9).
Note the missing blank between \fB-m\fP and \fIRS02\fP.
.TP
\fBdvdisaster\fP \fB-i\fP \fImedium.iso\fP \fB-e\fP \fIcorr.ecc\fP \fB-f\fP
Repairs the image file \fImedium.iso\fP using the error correction file \fIcorr.ecc\fP.
.TP
\fBdvdisaster\fP \fB-i\fP \fImedium.iso\fP \fB-e\fP \fIcorr.ecc\fP \fB-t\fP
Verifies the image \fImedium.iso\fP with information from
the error correction file \fIcorr.ecc\fP.
.TP
\fBNOTE:\fP
Omit the \fB-e corr.ecc\fP options when working with augmented images in the examples above.

.SH OPTIONS
Action selection (at least one action must be specified):
.TP
.B \-r, \-\-read

e.g. -r100-200.
.TP
.B \-c, \-\-create
Create .ecc information for the medium image.
.TP
.B \-f, \-\-fix
Try to fix medium image using .ecc information.
.TP
.B \-s, \-\-scan
Scan the medium for read errors.
.TP
.B \-t, \-\-test
Test integrity of the .iso and .ecc files.
.TP
.B \-u, \-\-unlink
Delete .iso files (when other actions complete).
.PP

Drive and file specification:
.TP
.B \-d, \-\-device device
read from given device (default: /dev/cdrom).
.TP
.B \-p, \-\-prefix prefix
prefix of .iso/.ecc file (default: medium.* ).
.TP
.B \-i, \-\-image imagefile
name of image file (default: medium.iso).
.TP
.B \-e, \-\-ecc eccfile
name of parity file (default: medium.ecc).
.TP
.B \-\-list
lists available drives for the ASPI driver (Windows only).
.PP

Tweaking options (see manual before using!):
.TP
.B \-j, \-\-jump n
jump n sectors forward after a read error (default: 16).
.TP
.B \-n, \-\-redundancy n[unit]
Error correction data redundancy. Allowed values depend
on the codec:

.RS
RS01 error correction files
.RS
\-n x\ \ creates error correction file with x roots.
.RE
.RS
\-n x% creates error correction file with x percent redundancy.
.RE
.RS
\-n xm creates error correction file of approx. x MB size.
.RE
.RS 
\-n normal - optimized codec for 14.3% redundancy/32 roots.
.RE
.RS
\-n high\ \ \ - optimized codec for 33.5% redundancy/64 roots.
.RE
.RE

.RS
RS02 images:
.RS
\-n CD\ \ \ augments image suitable for CD media.
.RE
.RS
\-n DVD\ \ augments image suitable for DVD media.
.RE
.RS
\-n DVD9 augments image suitable for DVD9 media.
.RE
.RS
\-n BD\ \ \ augments image suitable for BD media.
.RE
.RS
\-n BD2\  augments image suitable for two layered BD media.
.RE
.RS
\-n x\ \ \ \ augments image using approx. x sectors in total.
.RE
.RS
\-n x%\ \ \ augments image with approx. x% redundancy. 
.RE
.RS
\-n xr\ \ \ augments image with x roots error correction data.
.RE
.RE
.TP
.B \-m, \-\-method n
lists/selects error correction methods (default: RS01).
.RS
Possible values are RS01 and RS02.
.RE
.TP
.B \-v, \-\-verbose n%
more diagnostic messages
.TP
.B \-\-adaptive-read
use optimized strategy for reading damaged media.
.TP
.B \-\-auto-suffix
automatically add .iso and .ecc file suffixes.
.TP
.B \-\-cache-size n
image cache size in MB during -c mode (default: 32MB).
.TP
.B \-\-dao
assume DAO disc; do not trim image end.
.TP
.B \-\-driver d (Linux only)
Chooses between the cdrom (CDROM_SEND_PACKET) driver and the
sg (SG_IO) driver for optical drives. Currently the older cdrom
driver is pre-selected; starting with dvdisaster V0.80 the newer
sg driver will be the default. Both drivers should work equally
well, anyways.
.TP
.B \-\-eject
eject medium after successful read.
.TP
.B \-\-fill-unreadable n
fill unreadable sectors with byte n
.TP
.B \-\-ignore-fatal-sense
continue reading after potentially fatal error condition.
.TP
.B \-\-internal-rereads n
internal read attempts for defective CD media sectors (default: -1)
.RS
The drive firmware usually retries unreadable sectors a few times before
giving up and returning a read error. It is more efficient to set this to 0 or 1
and manage read attempts through the --read-attempts parameter. Most drives ignore
this setting anyways. Use -1 to leave the drive at its default setting.
.RE
.TP
.B \-\-query-size n
queries drive or filesystem on medium for image size (default: ecc)
.RS
Possible values are: drive udf ecc 
.RE
.TP
.B \-\-raw-mode n
selects raw reading mode for CD media (default: 20)
.RS
The recommended mode is 20, which makes the drive apply its built-in error 
correction to the best possible extent before transfering a defective sector.
However some drives can only read defective sectors using mode 21, skipping
the last stage of the internal error correction and returning 
the uncorrected sector instead.
.RE
.TP
.B \-\-read-attempts n-m
attempts n upto m reads of a defective sector.
.TP
.B \-\-read-medium n
read the whole medium up to n times.
.TP
.B \-\-read-raw
performs read in raw mode if possible.
.TP
.B \-\-speed-warning n
print warning if speed changes by more than n percent.
.TP
.B \-\-spinup-delay n
wait n seconds for drive to spin up.
.TP
.B \-\-split-files
split image into files <= 2GB.
