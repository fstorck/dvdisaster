<b><a name="nls">2.1 Which translations of the program are available?</a></b><p>

The current version of dvdisaster contains screen texts in the following languages:<p>

<table>
<tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>Czech</td><td>--</td><td>upto version 0.66</td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td>English</td><td>--</td><td>complete</td></tr>
<tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>German</td><td>--</td><td>complete</td></tr>
<tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>Italian</td><td>--</td><td>upto version 0.65</td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td>Portuguese</td><td>--</td><td>complete</td></tr>
<tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>Russian</td><td>--</td><td>complete</td></tr>
<tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>Swedish</td><td>--</td><td>upto version 0.70</td></tr>
</table><p>

Translators for other languages are welcome!<p>

dvdisaster will automatically obtain language settings from the operating system.
If the local language is not yet supported, english text will be used. 
A different language can be selected using environment variables.<p>

Example for the bash shell and german language:

<pre>export LANG=de_DE</pre>

If special characters like german umlauts are not displayed properly,
try the following:<p>

<tt>export OUTPUT_CHARSET=iso-8859-1</tt> (X11, XTerm)

<b><a name="media">2.2 Which media types are supported?</a></b><p>

dvdisaster supports (re-)writeable CD, DVD and BD media. <br>
Media containing multiple sessions or copy protections can <i>not</i> be used.<p>

Usable media by type:<p>

<b>CD-R, CD-RW</b><p>

<ul>
 <li>only Data CD are supported.</li>
</ul>

<b>DVD-R, DVD+R</b><p>

<ul>
<li>No further limitations are known.</li>
</ul>

<b>DVD-R DL, DVD+R DL (two layers)</b>
<ul>
<li>The drive must be able to <a href="qa20.php#dvdrom">identify the medium type</a>.
Typically this is only the case for drives which can also write two layered media.</li>
</ul>

<b>DVD-RW, DVD+RW</b><p>

<ul>
<li>Some drives report wrong <a href="qa20.php#rw">image sizes</a>.<br>
Remedy: Determine the image size from the ISO/UDF file system or the ECC/RS02 data.
</li></ul>

<b>DVD-RAM</b><p>
<ul>
<li>Usable only when written with ISO/UDF images like DVD-R/-RW;</li>
<li>Not supported when used as removeable medium / for packet writing.</li>
<li>Similar issues with <a href="qa20.php#rw">image size</a>
recognition as noted above.</li>
</ul>

<b>BD-R, BD-RW</b><p>

<ul>
<li>No limitations are known so far, but very few results
on the two-layered type (the 50GB variety) have been reported yet.
</li>
</ul>

<b>Not usable types</b> (image can not be extracted):<p>
BD-ROM (pressed BDs), DVD-ROM (pressed DVDs), CD-Audio and CD-Video.

<b><a name="filesystem">2.3 Which file systems are supported?</a></b><p>

dvdisaster works exclusively on the image level
which is accessed sector-wise.
That means it does not matter with which file system the medium has been formatted.<p>

Since dvdisaster neither knows nor uses the file system structure,
it can not repair logical errors at the file system level.
It can not recover lost or deleted files.

<b><a name="aspi">2.4 What does "SPTI" and "ASPI" mean?</a></b><p>

Windows 98 and ME use drivers called "ASPI" to access CD/DVD drives.
Windows NT and its successors provide similar functionality
through an interface named "SPTI", but do still allow the installation
of additional ASPI drivers.<p>

<i>&gt;&nbsp; Pro and Con of installing ASPI under Windows NT/2000/XP:</i><p>

<table>
<tr valign=top><td>+</td><td>No administrator priviledges needed for accessing the drives.</td></tr>
<tr valign=top><td>-</td><td>ASPI does not map well onto the Windows drive letters.</td></tr>
<tr valign=top><td>-</td><td>Some CD/DVD writing programs install
their own ASPI drivers. Installing another ASPI driver may interfere 
with the existing software.</td></tr>
</table><p>

<i>&gt;&nbsp; Which ASPI versions are recommended for use with dvdisaster?</i><p>

Adaptec provides their ASPI drivers free of charge for download.
Sometimes versions 4.72.* have difficulties recognizing drives under
Windows 2000/XP. Downgrading to version 4.60 usually helps in such
cases.<p>

<i>&gt;&nbsp; Drive letters are wrong under ASPI!</i><p>

ASPI drivers use their own system of identifying drives, which does
not support the drive letter scheme of Windows.<br>
In order to provide a unified access to SPTI and ASPI,
dvdisaster tries to guess the mapping of ASPI drives to drive letters.
However this does not work under all configurations.<p>

The --list function prints out
the current mapping of drive letters.<p>

<i>&gt;&nbsp; How to select between SPTI and ASPI?</i><p>

dvdisaster will automatically choose between SPTI and ASPI, 
deciding in favor of SPTI if both are available. 
Usage of ASPI can be forced; see the description of the
--list function for details.
