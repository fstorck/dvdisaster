<?php begin_screen_shot("\"Image\" tab.","create-prefs-image.png"); ?>
<b>"Image" tab.</b> Make sure that the image size is determined
using the "ISO/UDF" setting and that the linear reading strategy is selected.
The required selections are marked green. Leave the other settings at their defaults.

<?php begin_screen_shot("\"Drive\" tab.","create-prefs-drive.png"); ?>
<b>"Drive" tab.</b> Reading data from the drive while it is spinning up
can generate spurious error reports. Adjust the spin up time for your drive
(typically 5-10 seconds) in the field marked green to make dvdisaster wait
for the appropriate time.<p>
Leave the other settings at the shown values.<p>
<?php end_screen_shot(); ?>

<?php begin_screen_shot("\"Read attempts\".","create-prefs-read-attempts.png"); ?>
<b>"Read attempts".</b> The option "Read and analyse raw sectors" (marked green)
uses additional information provided by the drive to check the integrity of read
data. This is recommended as we are interested in creating 
error correction data from a properly read image.
On the other hand since error correction data can only be created from fully
readable media we do not need multiple reading attempts and caching of raw sectors
as shown in the screen shot.

<?php begin_screen_shot("\"Error correction\" tab.","create-prefs-ecc.png"); ?>
<b>"Error correction" tab.</b> First choose "Error correction file (RS01)" in
the "Storage method" list (green marking). By picking the redundancy you will
determine the maximum error correction capability: An error correction file
with x% redundancy can correct up to x% of read errors under optimal circumstances.
Since the best case is usually not encountered you should add some safety margin
to the redundancy by picking one of the following choices (see yellow markings);

<ul>
<li>The "normal" and "high" presets provide a redundancy of 14.3% and 33.5%
respectively. These two settings are very fast in creating error correction
files due to optimized program code.</li>
<li>You can freely choose the redundancy by activating the "other" item and dragging
the slider.</li>
<li>By activating the "Use at most" button you can specify the error correction
file size in MB. dvdisaster will choose a suitable redundancy so that the
error correction file will be close to but not larger than the specified size.
</li>
</ul>

The redundancy will also determine the size of the error correction file;
using x% redundancy will create an error correction file of about x% the size
of the image. Using redundancies lower than the "normal" setting (14.3%) is not
recommended as the error correction might be overloaded too quickly.
<?php end_screen_shot(); ?>

<?php begin_screen_shot("\"Files\" tab.","create-prefs-file.png"); ?>
<b>"Files" tab.</b> If your operating system can not create files larger than 2GB
then you must choose the "Split files " setting (marked green). 
In that case dvdisaster will
create up to 100 segments called "medium00.iso", "medium01.iso" etc. instead
of a single "medium.iso" file. Using this option results in a small performance hit.
This option is mostly useful under Windows if the old FAT32 file system is still used.
Leave the other settings off for the moment; suggestions for further 
<a href="howtos25.php">optimization</a> follow later.

<b>Not used tabs</b><p>

The "Misc" tab currently has only functions for creating
log files. This is helpful for sending in <a href="feedback.php">bug reports</a>
but should be left off during normal operation.
The "Appearance" tab allows you to adapt the output colors to your taste, 
but these have no further effects on the error correction data creation.
